abstract = {Summary Reliable estimates of animal density and abundance are essential for effective wildlife conservation and management. Camera trapping has proven efficient for sampling multiple species, but statistical estimators of density from camera trapping data for species that cannot be individually identified are still in development. We extend point-transect methods for estimating animal density to accommodate data from camera traps, allowing researchers to exploit existing distance sampling theory and software for designing studies and analysing data. We tested it by simulation, and used it to estimate densities of Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Densities estimated from simulated data were unbiased when we assumed animals were not available for detection during long periods of rest. Estimated duiker densities were higher than recent estimates from line transect surveys, which are believed to underestimate densities of forest ungulates. We expect these methods to provide an effective means to estimate animal density from camera trapping data and to be applicable in a variety of settings.},

  abstract = {Distance sampling (DS) is a widely used framework for estimating animal abundance. DS models assume that observations of distances to animals are independent. Non-independent observations introduce overdispersion, causing model selection criteria such as AIC or AICc to favour overly complex models, with adverse effects on accuracy and precision. We describe, and evaluate via simulation and with real data, estimators of an overdispersion factor (), and associated adjusted model selection criteria (QAIC) for use with overdispersed DS data. In other contexts, a single value of is calculated from the ``global'' model, that is the most highly parameterised model in the candidate set, and used to calculate QAIC for all models in the set; the resulting QAIC values, and associated {$\Delta$}QAIC values and QAIC weights, are comparable across the entire set. Candidate models of the DS detection function include models with different general forms (e.g. half-normal, hazard rate, uniform), so it may not be possible to identify a single global model. We therefore propose a two-step model selection procedure by which QAIC is used to select among models with the same general form, and then a goodness-of-fit statistic is used to select among models with different forms. A drawback of this approach is that QAIC values are not comparable across all models in the candidate set. Relative to AIC, QAIC and the two-step model selection procedure avoided overfitting and improved the accuracy and precision of densities estimated from simulated data. When applied to six real datasets, adjusted criteria and procedures selected either the same model as AIC or a model that yielded a more accurate density estimate in five cases, and a model that yielded a less accurate estimate in one case. Many DS surveys yield overdispersed data, including cue counting surveys of songbirds and cetaceans, surveys of social species including primates, and camera-trapping surveys. Methods that adjust for overdispersion during the model selection stage of DS analyses therefore address a conspicuous gap in the DS analytical framework as applied to species of conservation concern.},

We introduce the R package Distance that implements distance sampling methods to estimate abundance. We describe how users can obtain estimates of abundance (and density) using the package as well as documenting the links it provides with other more specialized R packages. We also demonstrate how Distance provides a migration pathway from previous software, thereby allowing us to deliver cutting-edge methods to the users more quickly.},
